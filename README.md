> [!NOTE]
> This is a personal fork of [mfkrause/homebridge-people-pro](https://github.com/mfkrause/homebridge-people-pro), which the original author archived after moving away from Homebridge. This fork applies the minimal changes needed to keep the plugin working on Homebridge v2 (see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)). It is not published to npm; install it directly from this repository (see Installation below).

This is a plugin for [homebridge](https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge). It monitors who is at home, based on their smartphone being seen on the network recently.
If you use the Elgato Eve app you can also see the history of every person sensor (powered by [fakegato](https://github.com/simont77/fakegato-history]) - only works for sensors configured as "motion" sensors).

It can also optionally spin up a webserver and receive webhooks sent by location-aware mobile apps (such as [Locative](https://my.locative.io)), which can use iBeacons and geofencing to provide faster and more accurate location information.

# Installation

1.  Install homebridge (if not already installed) using: `npm install -g homebridge`
2.  Install this fork directly from GitHub using: `npm install -g github:riccardoq76/homebridge-people-pro`
    (this plugin is not published on npm, so `npm install -g homebridge-people-pro` would install the original, unmaintained package instead of this fork)
3.  Update your configuration file (see below).

# Configuration

See `config-sample.json` for an example configuration. This plugin can also be configured through a GUI like [homebridge-config-ui-x](https://github.com/oznu/homebridge-config-ui-x).

# How it works

-   When started, homebridge-people-pro will continually ping (or ARP lookup if configured) the IP address associated with each person defined in config.json if `pingInterval` is not set to `-1`. If a hostname is given as a target, you can also define custom DNS servers to use for the look-up. If a MAC address is given as a target, the plugin will try to look-up its IP address through ARP before pinging.
-   With an iBeacon or geofencing smartphone app, you can configure a HTTP push to trigger when you enter and exit your 'home' region. This data will be combined with the ping functionality if used to give this plugin more precise presence data.
-   When a ping is successful, the current timestamp is logged to a database.
-   When a HomeKit enabled app looks up the state of a person, the last seen time for that persons device is compared to the current time minus `threshold` minutes, and if it is greater it is assumed that the person is active.

## 'Anyone' and 'No One' sensors

Some HomeKit automations need to happen when "anyone" is home or when "no one" is around. homebridge-people-pro can automatically create additional "Anyone" and "No One" sensors to make these automations very easy.

For example, you might want to run your "Arrive Home" scene when *Anyone* gets home. Or run "Leave Home" when *No One* is home.

These sensors can be enabled by adding `"anyoneSensor" : true` and/or `"nooneSensor" : true` to your homebridge `config.json` file.

## Accuracy

This plugin requires that the devices being monitored are connected to the network. iPhones (and other devices) may deliberately disconnect from the network once the screen is turned off to save power, meaning just because the device isn't connected, it doesn't mean that the devices owner isn't at home. Fortunately, most of these devices periodically reconnect to the network to check for updates, emails, etc. This plugin works by keeping track of the last time a device was seen, and comparing that to a threshold value (in minutes).

From a *very* limited amount of testing, it was found that a threshold of 15 minutes seems to work well for most phones. The threshold can be configured individually for each sensor.

Additionally, if you're using a location-aware mobile app to range for iBeacons and geofences, this plugin can receive a HTTP push from the app to immediately see you as present or not present when you physically enter or exit your desired region. This is particularly useful for "Arrive Home" and "Depart Home" HomeKit automations which ideally happen faster than every 15 minutes.

## Pairing with a location-aware mobile app

Apps like [Locative](https://my.locative.io) range for iBeacons and geofences by using core location APIs available on your smartphone. With Bluetooth and location services turned on, these apps can provide an instantaneous update when you enter and exit a desired region.

To use this plugin with one of these apps, configure your region and set the HTTP push to `http://[ipaddress]:[port]/?sensor=[name]&state=true` for arrival, and `http://[ipaddress]:[port]/?sensor=[name]&state=false` for departure, where `[ipaddress]` is the IP address of your Homebridge, `[port]` the configured port for the webhooks (defaults to 51828) and `[name]` the name of the person the device belongs to as specified in your config under `people`. *Note:* You may need to enable port forwarding on your router to accomplish this.

# Notes

## Running on a raspberry pi as non 'pi' user

On some versions of raspbian, users are not able to use the ping program by default. If none of your devices show online try running `sudo chmod u+s /bin/ping`. Thanks to oberstmueller for the tip.

## Running in a docker-environment

On some docker-environments (alpine-based for example) it is possible that the ping does not. Please try to install *iptools* in this case via `apk add iputils --no-cache`
